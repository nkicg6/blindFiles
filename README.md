# blindFiles
Blinds files in a directory by renaming them with a 3 digit number
This contians two main functions and runs through an IDE.The functions blindImages and unBlind take a file path as an argument. blindImages counts the tif files and determines how many random numbers you need to blind the files. Then it renames and copies the files to a new directory.
unblind reverses this option. For safety, blindFiles and unBlind copy the files before renaming them so the originals are unaffected.
